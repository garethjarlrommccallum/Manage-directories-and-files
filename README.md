<h1>Manage Directories and files</h1>

Creating, removing, and editing directories and files are essential tasks for effective data management. Maintaining an organized structure not only streamlines access to information but also makes it easier to identify potential issues and ensure the security of the data.

<h2>Objective</h2>
Organize the /home/analyst directory by making specific changes to its structure and contents. These changes include creating a new logs subdirectory, removing the temp subdirectory, moving the Q3patches.txt file to the reports subdirectory, deleting the tempnotes.txt file, and creating a new tasks.txt file in the notes subdirectory with a note detailing the tasks performed.
